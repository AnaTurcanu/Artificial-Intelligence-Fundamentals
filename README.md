# Artificial-Intelligence-Fundamentals

The system allows the user to answer some questions about a
possible tourist. If the set of given answers matches a type of tourist from the database, this
is the systemâ€™s answer. If on the other hand, the system determines that the person
in question is a Loonie, the answer is accordingly.

**The system has 3 files:**
- Citizen.py
- TouristTypes.py
- Result.py

### Citizen Class
The citizen's behaviour is defined in the Citizen.py file within the Citizen class. It has two methods, one of which is the constructor.
In the constructor, we defined the main characteristics of any citizen as a general rule, be it a tourist or a Loonie, 
such as having, hair, eyes, skin, headshape, height and language spoken.
The constructor is represented in the Figure below.
